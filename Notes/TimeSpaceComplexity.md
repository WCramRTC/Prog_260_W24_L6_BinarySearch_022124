Certainly! Let's break down the time and space complexity of the binary search algorithm:

### Time Complexity Analysis:

- **Best Case:** O(1)
  - The best-case scenario for binary search occurs when the target element is found at the middle of the array in the first iteration.
  - In this case, the algorithm terminates after a single comparison.
  - Thus, the time complexity is constant, O(1).

- **Average and Worst Case:** O(log n)
  - In the average and worst-case scenarios, binary search repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
  - At each step, the size of the search space is halved.
  - Therefore, the number of iterations required to find the target is proportional to the logarithm of the size of the array.
  - Thus, the time complexity of binary search in the average and worst cases is O(log n).

### Space Complexity Analysis:

- Binary search has a space complexity of O(1).
- The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space for storing variables like `left`, `right`, and `mid`.
- Regardless of the size of the input array, the space required remains constant.
- This makes binary search space-efficient, as it does not require additional memory proportional to the size of the input array.

### Summary:

- Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n) in the average and worst cases, making it very efficient for searching in sorted arrays.
- The space complexity of binary search is O(1), indicating that it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
- Binary search is a fast and space-efficient algorithm for finding elements in sorted arrays.
